Foursquare's venue explore functions and rating\n-  Study the coffee shops nearby venues, classify them and find out what areas/features may lead to an opportunity for investments.\n-  Study coffee shops types, franchise or not, and study their statistical characteristics such as their mean rating.\n\nBased on the above study, one can formulate an idea of what makes a coffee shop special and what locations may be ideal for a coffee shop business.",
